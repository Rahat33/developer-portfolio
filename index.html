            <p>
                My name is Rahat & I'm a Front End Engineer based in Dhaka ☀️. I describe myself as a passionate
                developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform ❤️.
                <br>
                Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a
                ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. Also I enjoy writing
                technical things ✍️ at my blog.

            <h2><span class="goal">Become a Full Stack Developer</span></h2>
            <p>In the modern world, if we talk about professional versatility, there’s no one better than a Full Stack
                Developer to represent the term “versatile.” Well-versed in both frontend and backend web development,
                Full Stack Developers are the multi-talented professionals that every company and brand covets. </p><br>
